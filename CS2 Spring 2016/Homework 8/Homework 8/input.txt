Horse race politics.
The first is the rating game.  
We seem to have become number happy.  
In this computerized era, it is all too easy to 
measure quantity and think we are measuring quality.  
We judge education by grade point averages and movies by 
the number of asterisks (or stars or some other symbols) 
assigned to them.  The future of television shows, beauty contest entrants, novels, and
even corporations rests on the ratings.  We have even been known to judge each other on 
a 10-point scale made famous in a Bo Derek movie a few years back.  During the 1988 
presidential campaign, many observers felt that both the media and the electorate were 
more concerned with ratings than with issues, with polls than with policies. 
As in a horse race, the main question had become "who is winning?"
